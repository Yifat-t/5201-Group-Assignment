## Branching Model:

Our Branching Model respects the following 6 principles:

1. Anything in the main branch is deployable.
2. To work on something new, we create a branch off from main and give a descriptively name.
3. Commit to that branch locally and regularly push our work to the same named branch on the server.
4. When we need feedback or help, or think the branch is ready for merging, we open a pull request.
5. After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, we can merge it into main.
6. Once it is merged and pushed to main, we can deploy.
